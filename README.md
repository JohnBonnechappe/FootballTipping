# FootballTipping
👀 Football tipping program in Fortran

✔ This program attempts to predict the outcome of future matches based on team performance in previous matches for the year.

✔ It predicts winning team and the expected scores. It also generates a ladder of top teams for the year.

🤷‍♀️ History: I wrote this program about fourty years ago in Fortran. It was originally coded on a CDC Cyber 830 mainframe but it should run with minimal changes on any platform with a Fortran compiler. It was thoroughly tested and I believe it is free of bugs.

🐱‍👤 Limitations: 1) This was written back in the day when there were only 12 football teams in Victoria so to use this program today
                    it would neeed tweaking to cater for extra teams.
                 2) I have not yet located the source code and I'm not even sure it still exists. All I have is a listing which I 
                    have scanned here. If I cant find the source code I will have to attempt to OCR the listing.
                 3) The program managed to prove that game results cannot be predicted solely from past performance. Lol.

😁Enjoy!
