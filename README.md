# FootballTipping
👀 Football tipping program in Fortran

✔ This program attempts to predict the outcome of future matches based on team performance in previous matches for the year.

✔ It predicts winning team and the expected scores. It also generates a ladder of top teams for the year.

🤷‍♀️ History: I wrote this program about fourty years ago in Fortran. It was originally coded on a CDC Cyber 830 mainframe but it should run with minimal changes on any platform with a Fortran compiler. It was thoroughly tested and I believe it is free of bugs.

🐱‍👤 Limitations: This was written back in the day when there were only 12 football teams in Victoria so to use this program today it would neeed tweaking to cater for extra teams.

😁Enjoy!
